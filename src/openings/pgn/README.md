# UHO opening suites

The match scripts expect the UHO 40/60 v4 opening suite extracted here as
`UHO_4060_v4.epd`. Run `src\scripts\prepare_resources.bat` to download the file
from the Stockfish books repository. You can also place alternative opening
books (PGN/EPD) in this directory if you wish to experiment with different
suites.

These large files are ignored by git via the local `.gitignore` to keep the
repository lightweight.
