# Revolution baseline build

Store the baseline Revolution executable that you want to use as a comparison
point in this folder. The batch scripts do not reference this directory
directly, but keeping the binary here provides a consistent place to archive
reference builds.

As with the other engine artefacts, binaries are not tracked by git to avoid
large commits. Copy the desired executable from your local Revolution build
outputs as needed.
