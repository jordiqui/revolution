![Revolution minimal logo](assets/revolution-logo.svg)

## Overview
Revolution is a strong UCI chess engine derived from Stockfish 17.1. The 2.90-231025
release introduces targeted optimisations and tuning curated with help from codex IA
while preserving the battle-tested strength of its Stockfish heritage.

## Highlights
- Modern NNUE-evaluated engine based on the Stockfish 17.1 search framework.
- codex IA assisted optimisations for evaluation speed and practical play strength.
- Fully compatible with UCI graphical interfaces such as Fritz, CuteChess, Arena, and more.

## Version identity
The engine identifies itself in UCI GUIs as:

```
revolution-2.90-231025 by Jorge Ruiz Centelles and codex IA and the Stockfish developers (see AUTHORS file)
```

The same name is embedded in the executable so that analysis reports from popular GUIs
can attribute results to Revolution 2.90-231025.

## Getting started
Refer to the `README.stockfish.md` file for detailed build and usage instructions. The
commands and options described there apply equally to Revolution.

## Credits
- Jorge Ruiz Centelles and codex IA for the Revolution direction and optimisation work.
- The Stockfish developers (see `AUTHORS`) for the original engine code base and ongoing
  chess engine research.
